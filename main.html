            <h2>Life Story</h2>
            <p>I was born on October 25th 2000 by Aaron and Katrina Panicho. We often moved alot in my first 10 years of my life, from one location to another in Virginia, Maryland, and Tennessee. 
                Then, we decided to move to Ripley, West Virgnia since we had family there, where I am at to this day. Had a great childhood with wonderful family, and friends. I was homeschooled, 
                from 2nd grade on-wards, and in my last two years of high-school, I went to a local vocational school where I learned drafting and a little bit of web and game design. I also clean 
                commercial building for work, and recently, I am now working with a man who does IT work in Charleston, WV, a nearby city, and I am now learning Software Engineering on Coding Temple.
            </p>
            <h2>My background, hobbies, and goals</h2>
            <p>I am a young guy that is living with his parents, and has two younger sisters as well, I am also single. I am also one of Jehovah's Witnesses, a religion that believes in the Bible 
                and it's teachings. I am also very interested in traveling to other places, including Colorado, Cozumel, Canada, Germany, Italy, and Australia. I also, like to play video games, such as 
                Minecraft, Super Mario games, King's Quest (2015), and so on. I also like to play billiard table (8-ball), pinball, and the piano. I also love maps, geography, science, and history. Those are not 
                the only hobbies that I have. I also enjoy reading books, looking at maps, hiking, tennis, basketball, golf, and bowling.
            </p>
            <h2>My future goals</h2>
            <p>I am very interested in moving to Colorado, because of the beauty of the mountains there, and there is a lot of sunshine and snow, and blue skies. I also enjoy the climate.
             Here is one of the pictures below.</p>
            <a href="images/colorado-3.jpg"><img class="article-image" src="images/colorado-3.jpg" alt="Estes Park, Colorado"></a>
            <p>I am also interested in learning other languages such as Spanish, and German. I also want to dig deeper into the Bible and to benifit from it and help others benifit from it too. There are more images of 
            places I visited that I enjoyed, they are in the "Gallery" page.</p>

            love to travel too! It is under the "FORM" page.</p>
